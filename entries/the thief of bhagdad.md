Begun in Britain but completed in California following the outbreak of war, this spectacular adventure based on tales from ‘1001 Nights’ may have had a piecemeal production – and no less than six directors, including the mighty Michael Powell – but you wouldn’t guess it from the result. Crammed with magical horses, terrifying transformations and gigantic genies, ‘The Thief of Baghdad’ made an international star of low-born Indian actor Sabu, aka the Elephant Boy.
